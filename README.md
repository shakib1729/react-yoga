## About The Project

The goal of this project is to classify the yoga poses performed by the user using machine learning so that they correctly perform the yoga poses.

### Project Overview

- Select one of the available pose (asana) and get score for performing that pose correctly
- Beat your best score
- Become proficient in performing asanas
- Toggle between Light and Dark modes

### Built With

This web app is developed using React and TensorflowJS

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - To build the user interface
- [TensorFlowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - To classify the yoga poses using PoseNet and custom Neural Network model

#### Additional libraries/packages used:

- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - The standard routing library for React
- [React-Webcam](https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam) - Webcam component for React
- [React-CSV](https://github.com/react-csv/react-csv) - To generate the CSV file of the dataset
- [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) - To parse the CSV files in browser

## Usage

The live version of this web app is deployed at: https://react-yoga.netlify.app
<br />
To set up locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shakib1729/react-yoga.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Development Process

![2021-04-03 12 19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39847281/113472095-489d7180-947e-11eb-92df-6e9359f5c667.jpg)

### Step 1) Collecting the Dataset

- [PoseNet model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) of TensorFlowJS was used to collect the dataset.
- The PoseNet model takes input an image of a body and outputs the coordinates (x and y) of 17 keypoints alongwith their name (like nose, leftEye, rightEye, etc.) and confidence scores. So each image gives 17\*2 = 34 values. These 34 values are features of a single data point.
- In this way, around 300 data points for each pose were taken using live webcam feed.
- Two CSV files (X and Y) containing the data points along with their lable were generated using react-csv,
- These CSV files are the dataset for the neural network.

### Step 2) Training the model

- A neural network was created using TensorFlowJS to perform the classification. It had two dense layers: the first dense layer had 10 units and activation function was 'relu'. The second dense layer was the output layer with 3 units and activation function was 'softmax'.
- The dataset files 'X' and 'Y' which were created in the previous step were parse using PapaParse and were shuffled and split such that 85% was the training data and 15% was the testing data.
- The following parameters were set: <br />
  Learning rate: 0.01 <br/>
  Number of epochs: 40 <br/>
  Optimizer: Adam optimizer <br/>
  Loss: Categorical cross-entropy <br/>
  Metrics: Accuracy <br/>
- The model was trained in the browser itself and accuracy of 99.12% was achieved.

### Step 3) Testing the model

- The neural network model created in the last step was used to make predictions on live webcam feed.
- Input from webcam was feeded to PoseNet model which generated a datapoint of 34 features.
- This datapoint was used as an input to the neural network model and prediction corresponding to that input image was obtained

### Step 4) Creating the final web app and deploying it

- The layout of webapp was created using CSS Grid
- User interface was created in React
- Routing was added to navigate to the about page
- Option to toggle between light and dark mode was added
- Stored theme preference and best scores in localStorage
